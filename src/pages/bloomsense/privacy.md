## Privacy Policy

This page applies to **BloomSense**, an Omnise app.

### What BloomSense records
BloomSense lets users record pH readings, symptoms, and timing/context for personal tracking.

### Local-first by default
BloomSense stores your logs locally on your device by default. No account is required for core features.

### Optional future sync
If we introduce optional cloud sync in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly explained at the time.

BloomSense does not collect, transmit, or share personal data off the device in Phase A features.
