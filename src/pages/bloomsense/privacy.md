### Local-first by default

BloomSense stores your logs locally on your device by default. No account is required for core features.

### Optional future sync

If we introduce optional cloud sync in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly explained at the time.

BloomSense does not collect, transmit, or share personal data off the device in Phase A features.
BloomSense does not use analytics, tracking, or third-party SDKs in Phase A.
