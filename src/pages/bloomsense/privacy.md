This policy applies to the publicly available version of the BloomSense mobile application (iOS and Android).

## Privacy Policy

This page applies to **BloomSense**, an Omnise app.

### What BloomSense records

BloomSense lets users record pH readings, symptoms, and timing/context for personal tracking.

### Local-first by default

BloomSense stores your logs locally on your device by default. No account is required for core features.

### Optional future sync

If we introduce optional cloud sync in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly explained at the time.

### Camera Usage

BloomSense uses your device's camera to scan and analyze Natureland pH test strips. Image processing is performed locally on your device. Images are not transmitted to or stored on our servers.

### Third-Party Services & Shop

BloomSense includes an in-app Shop powered by the **Shopify Storefront API**.
- **Product Browsing**: When you browse products, your device communicates with Shopify's servers to retrieve product information.
- **Purchases**: Checkout and payments are processed securely by Shopify.
- **Health Data Separation**: Your personal health logs (pH readings, symptoms) are stored **locally** on your device and are **not** shared with Shopify or linked to your shopping activity.

BloomSense does not use third-party analytics or tracking SDKs for your health data.
