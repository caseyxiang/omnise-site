## Privacy Policy

BloomSense collects different types of data depending on how you use the app.

**Private Health Data** (visible only to you):
- pH readings, symptoms, and context (including menstrual period flow and intimacy/sexual activity data)
- Custom tags and reminders
- This data is stored locally on your device. If you create a registered account, it is also encrypted and synced to our cloud servers for backup and cross-device access.

**Community Profile Data** (visible to other users):

### 2. Guest vs. Registered Accounts

**Guest Users**: You can use BloomSense without creating an account. Your health data is stored locally on your device only. You can participate in the community with an anonymous profile, but your data cannot be recovered if you uninstall the app.

**Registered Users**: When you sign in with Google or Apple, your health data is synced to our cloud servers. Your community profile and activity are associated with your account and can be accessed across devices.

### 3. How We Use Your Data

- **Health Data**: Used solely to provide your personal tracking experience. We do not analyze, monetize, or share your health data with any third party.
- **Community Data**: Used to display your posts, comments, and profile to other community members.
- **Push Notifications**: Used to notify you of likes, comments, and replies on your posts (registered users only).

**Account Deletion**: You can permanently delete your community account and all associated data (profile, posts, comments, likes, images) from the Privacy & Data page. Local health logs on your device are not affected by account deletion.

### 8. Do Not Sell My Personal Information

BloomSense does not sell, share, or trade your personal information with third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We do not use your data for advertising or share it with data brokers. Your health data is used exclusively for your personal tracking, and your community data is used solely to provide the BloomSense community experience.
