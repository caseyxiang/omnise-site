### What FoodSense records
FoodSense allows users to log food-related observations, routines, and reactions for personal tracking.

### Local-first by default
FoodSense stores your logs locally on your device by default. No account is required for core features.

### Optional future sync
If we introduce optional cloud sync in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly explained at the time.
