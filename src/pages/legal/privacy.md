## Privacy Policy

**Omnise, a product of SIXPINES PRODUCTS INC** (“Omnise,” “we,” “us”) builds personal tracking applications designed to help users organize and review information collected through simple tests and observations. We respect your privacy and design our products to minimize data collection.

### 1. Local-first storage (default)
By default, Omnise apps store your logs locally on your device. No account is required for core features.

### 2. What information you may provide in the apps
Depending on the product, you may choose to record:
- User-captured photos of test materials (optional)
- User-entered notes, timestamps, and categories
- App settings and preferences

### 3. Camera usage
If you enable camera access, it is used only when you choose to capture an image. Processing is intended to occur on-device where feasible.

### 4. No cloud sync by default; optional future sync
Omnise apps do **not** upload or synchronize your personal logs to our servers by default. We may introduce optional cloud features in the future; if we do, they will be **opt-in**, clearly explained, and you will be able to use core features without cloud sync.

### 5. Sharing
We do not sell personal data. If an app offers an export/share feature, it will be user-initiated.

### 6. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date at the top indicates when it was last revised.
