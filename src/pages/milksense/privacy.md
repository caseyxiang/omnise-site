## Privacy Policy

This page applies to **MilkSense**, an Omnise app.

### What MilkSense records
MilkSense records user-captured or user-entered test results as **visual categories only**, displayed as **Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3**.

- MilkSense does not calculate or display numeric alcohol values.
- Any categorization is intended for organization and education, based on user-provided or user-confirmed input.

### Camera usage
If you enable camera access, it is used only when you choose to capture an image of a test result.

### Local-first by default
MilkSense stores your logs locally on your device by default. No account is required for core features.

### Optional future sync (opt-in)
If we add optional cloud sync in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly explained at the time.
