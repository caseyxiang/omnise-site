## Privacy Policy

This page applies to **PoolSense**, an Omnise app.

### What PoolSense records
PoolSense is designed for logging pool test strip observations and maintenance history. It is not focused on personal health data.

### Local-first by default
PoolSense stores your logs locally on your device by default. No account is required for core features.

### Optional future sync
If we introduce optional cloud sync in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly explained at the time.
